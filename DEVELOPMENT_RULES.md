# Development Rules

## Deployment & Version Control

- **Unauthorized Deployment**: Do NOT push code to the remote repository (GitHub/Cloudflare) without explicit user permission.
- **Auto-Deploy Scripts**: Do NOT run `auto_deploy.js` or `deploy.bat` unless the user specifically commands "deploy", "submit", or similar. 
- **Wait for Confirmation**: Always ask for confirmation before performing any action that affects the live production environment.
